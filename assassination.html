                 Fred Hampton (1948-1969)
                 <p>During the Civil Rights Movement in The US there were people whose charisma and determination for change led them to places of leadership among freedom fighters. Fred Hampton was one of those leaders who gave everything he could for the cause. At the young age of twenty-one Fred was already leading a chapter of the Black Panther Party, and raising alarms with the government for his ability to unite and energize people.
                    Being outspoken and fearless made him a target for silencing.<br><br>
                    This book is an exploration of the painstakingly long court case against the state and government to uncover their roles in a raid on Fred Hampton's Chicago apartment on December 4, 1969. As lawyers at the People's Law Office learned more about the events of that day, they pieced together the truth that involved corruption, perjury, a disruption of the movement using a covert operation called COINTELPRO and the assaination of Fred Hampton.
