                        Ida B. Wells (1862-1931)
                        <br>
                        <p>30 years after the Civil War, 'free' Black people were still treated as second class citizens and vulnerable to attacks by white people. After reporting on the lynching of a friend and local community member in her newspaper, <em>The Free Speech</em>, Ida was forced to stay away from her home in Memphins, Tennessee or risk being killed as well. </p>
                        <p>This exile became a catalyst for advocating for an end to lynchings and the mistreatment of Black citizens. Ida needed to write and speak about what was happening in her community and in Black communities across the U.S. She devoted her adult life to exposing the devastating truth of lynchings and inequality that Black people were subjected to while living under Jim Crow laws. </p>
                        <p>The killing of Black Americans by white mobs set on maintaining the status quo of white supremacy needed to stop. 
                        This book is a brief but dense account of the ways Ida B. Wells turned her words into action, bringing truth to the light.</p>
